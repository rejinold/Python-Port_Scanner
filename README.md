# Python-Port_Scanner
This is a basic Port Scanner for beginners. Anyone who is willing to do Network Pentesting or Ethical Hacking with Python can start off with this basic script. I encourage you to modify and develop this tool to skill up your level.

If you are a super beginner I would encourage you to start learing Python3. It is super important when it comes to Ethical Hacking or Penetration Testing stuffs like that.
